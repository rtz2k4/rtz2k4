- 👋 Hi, I’m @rtz2k4
  
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, I know to program in Python, C and C++. Also, I tried Pascal to broaden
  my programming knowledge and I have some basic experience with SQL.
  Beyond code, I am also quite decent at mathematics. I find myself captivated by the complexities of the human
  mind through psychology, philosophy and politics.
  In my free time, I enjoy chess, watch movies and explore content on Youtube.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Rust.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, open-source projects, participate in hackathons, etc.
